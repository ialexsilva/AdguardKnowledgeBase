## Introdução

Filter is a set of filtering rules for advertising content (banners, pop-ups and such). AdGuard is supplied with a set of standard filters created by us. They are being constantly improved and supplemented, and hopefully satisfy most users. From time to time, each AdGuard application checks for updates of all enabled ad filters.

There are several options to tell us about the problem with advertising filters. You can send a complaint via the program or browser extension, or you can contact us on the [forum](https://forum.adguard.com/?langid=1).

Filters are designed for use in all AdGuard products. If you wish, you can also use them in Adblock Plus. However note that the syntax of Adguard filtering rules is more advanced than in ABP. Therefore, part of the rules will not work in ABP.

You can find a manual of filtering rules creation syntax on [this link](/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters).

<a name="annoyances"></a>

## Filtro de Aborrecimentos

Blocks irritating elements on webpages, including cookie notices, third-party widgets and in-page popups (Doesn’t include social media widgets and buttons, to block them you can still use Social media filter separately). It was inspired by Fanboy Annoyances List, but doesn’t duplicate it, so you can use them both together.

<a name="russian"></a>

## Filtro Russo

Filter that enables removing of the ads from websites in Russian. The filter was created 5 years ago. Initially, the work on creation of this filter was based on [RU AdList](https://code.google.com/p/ruadlist/) filter and a set of rules developed by us. Subsequently, the filter was developed completely independently, so at this point there are very little intersections with RU AdList left.
